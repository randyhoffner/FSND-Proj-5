## Randy's Liquor App
This project uses Flask, sqlalchemy, and sqlight to generate a catalog of Liquor categories, with a brief description of the category.  Each category contains a menu of several items of liquor that fit into that category, with a brief description of each item.

Categories with their descriptions may be individually created, edited, or deleted, and within each category menu, items and their descriptions may be created, edited, or deleted.

When first opening the app, the public list of categories and the public list of category menus of items are seen.  Contents may only be altered by a user who is signed in, and then a given user may only alter that user's own entries.

Login to the app is via Google+ Login.
